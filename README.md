**Course**: MS-AAI (Applied Artificial Intelligence) ‚Äî University of San Diego  
**Team**: Team 7  
**Project Title**: Insurance Cost Analysis

---

## Project Overview  
This notebook-based project explores predicting health insurance charges by using four regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor. 
Our objective is to build, evaluate, and compare ML/AI models that address the research question:  
> *‚ÄúTo identify the most influential factors affecting insurance pricing and provide data-driven insights that can support fairer and more efficient pricing strategies.‚Äù*

Key features:  
- Data ingestion, cleaning and preprocessing of the medical insurance cost dataset from Kaggle
- Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training, evaluation and comparison
- Interpretation of results + actionable insights
